# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)

## 📘 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using data like age, class, gender, fare, and more.

## 🧩 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Embarked, etc.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- EDA using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Feature engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone, Title)
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score

## 📈 Results
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 81.6%
- Engineered features significantly improved model performance

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Google Colab

## ✅ Key Learnings
